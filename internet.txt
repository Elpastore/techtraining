The internet is a global network that connects millions of computers worldwide.
It allows the exchange of information through various protocols and services. Key concepts include:

  1.Network Protocols: Internet protocols like TCP/IP facilitate communication between devices.
  2.World Wide Web (WWW): A system of interconnected documents and resources accessible via the internet.
  3.Browsers: Software applications that enable users to navigate and interact with web content.
  4.HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Core technologies for creating and designing web pages.
  5.Security: Considerations such as HTTPS, firewalls, and secure coding practices.
Server is also an important part of Internet.
A server is a computer or system that provides services to other computers, known as clients, over a network.
Key concepts related to servers include:
  -Types of Servers: Different servers serve various purposes, such as web servers, database servers, and file servers.
  -Web Server: Handles HTTP requests and serves web content to clients (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
  -Database Server: Manages database queries and transactions, providing data storage and retrieval.
  -File Server: Stores and manages files, allowing clients to access and share them.
  -Client-Server Architecture: The model where clients request services, and servers provide those services.
  -IP Address and DNS: Servers are identified by IP addresses, and DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.
  -Load Balancing: Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal performance and reliability.
  -Security Measures: Firewalls, encryption, and access controls are crucial for server security.
Internet include networking and sharing data(information). So to make sure that data exhange is secure there are some method(algorithm), protocol used for this purpose such as HTTPS, SSL etc.
that use asymetric key encryption(private and public key) to encrypt data.
